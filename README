Description: An addictive game where you manipulate the gravity around you to destroy many waves of incoming enemies. You have the ability to create particles, push them away, and attract them to you. In order to destroy the enemies, you have to hit them with the particles. The faster the particles are moving, the more damage they do. Special powers and many varied types of enemies add variety for a fun, fast-paced arcade game!
